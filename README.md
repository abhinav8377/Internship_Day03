<h1>Vulnerability Research and Mitigation Strategies</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>
Perform a basic vulnerability scan on your system using free security tools to identify common vulnerabilities and understand potential risks.

<h2>Tools Used</h2>
OpenVAS (Community Edition) OR
Nessus Essentials (Free Edition)

<h2>Steps Performed</h2>
1. Installed Nessus Essentials on my system. <br>
2. Configured the scan target as localhost / system IP. <br>
3. Initiated a full vulnerability scan. <br>
4. Waited for the scan to complete (approx. 30â€“60 minutes). <br>
5. Analyzed the generated report for vulnerabilities and severity levels. <br>
6. Researched remediation steps for the critical findings. <br>
7. Documented results and captured screenshots for evidence. <br>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
1. Gained hands-on experience with vulnerability scanning. <br>
2. Understood common security issues that exist on personal computers. <br>
3. Learned how to interpret CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) ratings. <br>
4. Practiced documenting and prioritizing vulnerabilities. <br>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>
1. Vulnerability scan report (PDF/HTML from the tool). <br>
2. Screenshots of key findings. <br>
3. Documentation of top critical vulnerabilities and mitigation steps. <br>
